          <p>
            LANs are a bring your own computer (BYOC) event: you should bring
            your own computer/console, display, and peripherals. You will be
            provided with two power sockets and one Ethernet connection to the
            LAN, as well as a desk and a chair.
            <br />
            There will be a well-stocked tuck shop for snacks but, of course,
            you&apos;re welcome to bring your own. <br />
            {/* TODO: See #food for food orders. */}
            If you&apos;re staying overnight, we recommend bringing something
            warm as well as a pillow and sleeping bag/duvet. Please also bring a
